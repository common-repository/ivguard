IVGuard is loaded with futures and more are on the way.

Here are some:

= 1. VERSION CONTROL =
WordPress has constant updates and new version of a plugins and themes. You can easily perform updates from the admin panel of your WordPress site. However sometimes these new versions or the old ones that you have become susceptible to hacker attacks. They might have vulnerabilities or bugs or just are not working properly. The version control of IVGuard plugin notifies you when some of these issues occur.

= 2. USERS CONTROL =
This feature will notify you about every change of the status of every user in your WordPress admin panel. You will also get a message when a new member is added, or an old one is removed. And that's how you'll be aware of every unauthorized action in your site.

= 3. FILE ARCHIVE =
Archived files are used to collect multiple data files together, and this is exactly what we are going to do with all of the PHP and JavaScript files your system uses, thus you can restore them at any point. And don’t worry the archives will be fresh because we backup them up couple of times a day.

= 4. FILE INTEGRITY CHECK =
IVGuard allows you to monitor your PHP or JavaScript via our interface. We will check them daily and make sure they haven’t been modified without your consent.

= 5. TIMESHIFT =
Compare your current website to previous versions. You can see which files have been changed, and decide if you need to do something about it.

= 6. FLOW CHANGES =
This function helps you keep track of any recent changes that have occurred to your website.

= 7. STOCK CHANGES =
IVGuard will also compare your plugins, theme and CMS to their stock versions. Any modifications made will be easily noticed.

= 8. FILE RESTORE =
Restore any JavaScript or PHP file at any moment. Thanks to our daily backup policy you will have fresh copies of your files.

= 9. BAD BOTS BLOCK =
Protection against suspicious bots - IVGuard monitors the activity of suspicious bot that are constantly scanning your site for exploits. When such an activity is detected IVGuard will block the access of the originating IP to the site. You can manage the block/unblock IP addresses on your personal dashboard. 

= 10. BRUTE-FORCE PROTECTION =
IVGuard will block each IP address that somebody or something tries to find your log-in credentials from. The suspension is for 24 hours and will block it again repetitively for another 24 hours if incorrect username or password are entered after the first period.

= 11. MASSIVE BRUTE-FORCE PROTECTION =
When comparing a common Brute-Force attack to a massive one, you can distinguish a massive attack, when in an interval of 3 minutes there are unsuccessful log in attempts from at least 3 different IP addresses.
If this happens IVGuard creates a second level of security to your website by adding a Master Security Code. That code is automatically sent to the administrator’s email. In case there are no more attacks this extra level of security is eliminated in 3 hours. Otherwise, another Master Security Code will be sent.

= 12. SELF-DEFENCE =
A hefty function that many webmasters overlook is the self-defense feature. This means that we will also check the state of the IVGuard Plugin on your website. This way we guarantee none of its functionality is lost due to hacker attacks.
